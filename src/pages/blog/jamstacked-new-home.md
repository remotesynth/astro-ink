As some of you may know, I've been writing the [Jamstacked](https://jamstack.email) newsletter for almost 3 years. Originally it was intended to be focused on Jamstack, but, even as that term has lost importance, it's continued to publish a lightly opinionated set of links around things like JavaScript frameworks, static site generators, serverless, APIs and integrations and deployment platforms as well as general web development and JavaScript. The most recent edition noted that the newsletter is moving on from its publisher Cooper Press and I am making it a part of my [CFE.dev](https://cfe.dev) community. Here's the details as published in the [most recent issue](https://cfe.dev/jamstacked/96/):

> New years often bring big changes. This newsletter isn't immune, but, as is usually the case with any change, there is both bad and good.
>
> This newsletter was first published by Cooperpress nearly three years ago in March of 2020. I approached them with the idea because the Jamstack community had grown so much that I saw a need. Plus, it was an opportunity to explore and share about some of my favorite tools and technologies. I am grateful that Peter, Chris, Kristina and the rest of Cooperpress collaborated with me to publish nearly 100 of these issues.
>
> The bad news is, this will be the last of these newsletters published by Cooperpress. However, this is not the end.
>
> Starting with the next issue (in two weeks), Jamstacked will be published as part of my [CFE.dev](https://jamstack.email/link/149872/39ee9d46c5) site. The [subscription](https://jamstack.email/link/149873/39ee9d46c5) and [archives](https://jamstack.email/link/149874/39ee9d46c5) are already live. If you are already subscribed via email, there's nothing for you to do other than note that future issues will come from an `@[cfe.dev](http://cfe.dev/)` address. If you're reading this elsewhere and aren't yet subscribed, [please do](https://jamstack.email/link/149873/39ee9d46c5) --- and if you are interested in sponsoring future newsletters, please [reach out to me via CFE.dev](https://jamstack.email/link/149875/39ee9d46c5).

> So, this is a note of thanks to Cooperpress for all their work but it is not a goodbye to you, my readers. Until next time!
